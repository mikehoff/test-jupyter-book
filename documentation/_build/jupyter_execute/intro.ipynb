    "### Applying Each Workshop to Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider again how each workshop's approach might fit your specific needs, regardless of the data source type or format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Reflect on Your Journey\n",
    "Think about which patterns could work for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Workshop 3: Initial Star Schema**\n",
    "   - **What we did**: Built a static dimensional model.\n",
    "   - **Practical takeaway**: While a one-off load isn't suitable for production, you might refresh your entire model periodically. Either way, getting your star schema design right is essential before adding automation.\n",
    "   - **Project question**: Could periodic full refreshes work for your data, or do you need more frequent updates? Does the format of your source (e.g., OLTP database, API, or flat file) affect your approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Workshop 4: Denormalised Data with Full Refresh**\n",
    "   - **What we did**: Loaded Companies House CSV data (already denormalised) into a simple table.\n",
    "   - **Practical takeaway**: Many data sources provide ready-to-load flat files, unlike the normalised Sakila database we're using today.\n",
    "   - **Project question**: Is your source data already flattened like Companies House, or do you need to transform a normalised or semi-structured source (e.g., JSON or XML)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Workshop 5: Serverless File Analysis**\n",
    "   - **What we did**: Direct querying of S3 files through AWS Athena.\n",
    "   - **Practical takeaway**: Sometimes maintaining a database is overkill when you can query files directly.\n",
    "   - **Project question**: Is your data best managed in a database, or could a serverless query approach suffice? For instance, does your source format (e.g., log files, IoT data) favour file-based analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workshop 6: Detailed Design**\n",
    "   - **What we did**: Specifications for dimensions and ETL processes.\n",
    "   - **Practical takeaway**: Planning your data flows and transformation rules saves major headaches later.\n",
    "   - **Project question**: Have you documented how your data flows and transformations will handle different source formats (e.g., structured databases, semi-structured APIs)?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Workshop 7: Automated Updates**\n",
    "   - **What we did**: Incremental dimension updates in Azure Synapse.\n",
    "   - **Practical takeaway**: Processing only what's changed is efficient for frequently updated data.\n",
    "   - **Project question**: What is your strategy for handling data changes from diverse sources (e.g., timestamp tracking in databases, new files in a directory, or API data deltas)? We’ll explore this today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, we'll explore more patterns such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Workshop 9 (Today): Stream Processing**\n",
    "   - **What we'll cover**: Processing data in real-time as it arrives.\n",
    "   - **Project relevance**: If batch updates aren't fast enough, streaming might be appropriate for certain sources, like IoT sensors or transactional events.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Workshop 13: API Integration**\n",
    "   - **What we'll cover**: Pulling data directly from one or more API sources.\n",
    "   - **Project relevance**: When your data lives in cloud services or external systems rather than the databases or files we've focused on so far.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Forward With Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "As you now consider the stream processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose Your Pattern**: Is your use case best served by:\n",
    "  - Regular full refreshes (like Workshop 4's Companies House approach)?\n",
    "  - Direct file querying (like Workshop 5's serverless pattern)?\n",
    "  - Incremental updates (like Workshop 7's Type 1 SCD implementation)?\n",
    "  - Or perhaps streaming as in today's workshop 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stream Appropriately**: Remember that complex solutions aren't always better:\n",
    "  - A simple near real time..\n",
    "  - This morning's exercise demonstrates one approach, but your project might need something simpler or more complex. We'll discuss the approaches after lunch, focusing on finding the right fit for your specific business needs!\n",
    "  - Fo instance, in this Tweet, it is suggested that.. https://x.com/EcZachly/status/1875002741711626444\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alignment with Data Engineer Pass Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This workshop aligns with several IFATE Data Engineer Pass Descriptors: https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/data-engineer-v1-0\n",
    "```\n",
    "````{dropdown} Click here to review more detail\n",
    "- **Explains techniques such as star schemas, data lakes and data marts and the impact they have on data warehousing principles. (K15)**  \n",
    " This workshop directly demonstrates this by showing how a star schema can be implemented and maintained in a data warehouse, specifically focusing on dimension table updates using SCD Type 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describes the types and uses of data engineering tools in their own organisation and how they apply them. (K20)**  \n",
    " The workshop covers multiple Azure data engineering tools (Azure SQL, Azure Synapse, Dedicated SQL Pools) and shows their practical application in building a data warehouse update pipeline, demonstrating how each tool serves a specific purpose in the overall architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explains the deployment approaches processes for new data pipelines and automated processes. (K8)**  \n",
    "  We walk through the complete deployment of a new data pipeline in Azure Synapse, from setting up the infrastructure to implementing and testing the automated update process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explains how they monitor different types of data store to optimise system management, performance and availability. (K1, S7)**  \n",
    "  We will implement audit logging tables to track pipeline success, and consideration of table distribution and udpate methods in Azure Synapse for optimised performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describes how they use data ingestion frameworks such as streaming, batching and on demand services to move data from one location to another in order to optimise data ingestion processes. (K18, S15)**  \n",
    "  We focus on batch processing and this workshop demonstrates an optimised ingestion process using staging tables and audit logging to ensure reliable data movement from OLTP to OLAP systems.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Today's Workshop Scenario and Objectives\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of the workshop, you will have built this architecture:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Note\n",
    "\n",
    "> Review the Glue Streaming guidance patterns starting here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/streaming-tutorial-studio.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Task 1: Configuring the Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Task 1, you will set up a development environment where weather data streaming and analytics can take place. This involves deploying a comprehensive AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation, which will create multiple interconnected services including a data ingestion pipeline (Lambda and Kinesis), storage layer (S3 data lake), and foundational analytics services (Redshift cluster and Glue database).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start an ACG AWS sandbox:** \n",
    "  - Use this link and start `AWS Sandbox - Default` and log in: https://learn.acloud.guru/cloud-playground/cloud-sandboxes <br>\n",
    "  ![AWS_ACG_start](./images/AWS_ACG_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "⌛ Your ACG Azure sandbox will automatically shut down and its data will be deleted after four hours. You will receive a notification one hour before the sandbox expires, allowing you to extend it for an additional four hours. Please plan your work accordingly to avoid disruptions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "🔃 If you encounter deployment issues or want to start fresh, we recommend deleting the entire sandbox from the ACG playground rather than individual resources or the CloudFormation stack. This is faster and ensures a clean slate for redeployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CloudFormation stack includes retention settings for resources like S3 buckets to avoid accidental data loss, and deletion can take 15–20 minutes due to dependencies between components (e.g., Lambda, Kinesis, Redshift). If you must delete the stack, empty S3 buckets manually first, as their deletion protection will block the process.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "⛔ When using AWS Glue, your ACG sandbox may shut down due to exceeding Glue DPU (Data Processing Unit) limits. You’ll receive an email titled “Your Hands-On Lab or Cloud Playground has been shut down,” explaining the suspension due to excessive DPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue jobs, being Spark-based, provision distributed computing environments even for small tasks, which can quickly hit ACG's limits designed to prevent runaway costs. This restriction is a helpful reminder of resource management in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your sandbox is suspended, don’t worry, this is part of learning to use powerful tools like AWS Glue. Simply start a new sandbox and redeploy the CloudFormation template, which will be ready in 3–4 minutes. Learn more about Glue DPUs and optimisation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-debug-capacity.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy AWS CloudFormation template:** \n",
    "  - Once logged in search for `CloudFormation`. \n",
    "  - At the top, click on the far right drop down `Create stack` and select `With new resources (standard)`\n",
    "  - At `Step 1: Create Stack` copy and paste this URL `https://da5corndel.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/CloudFormation_streaming.yaml` into the `Amazon S3 URL` box and click `Next`.\n",
    "  ![CloudFormation_S3_URL](./images/CloudFormation_S3_URL.png)<br><br>\n",
    "  - At `Step 2: Specify stack details` notice how may of the parameters are pre-completed for you and don't need to be changed. The only task here is to complete `Provide a stack name`. As this name is used to create resources a simple name is recommended such as `stream`. Then click `Next`.\n",
    "  ![CloudFormation_step2](./images/CloudFormation_step2.png)<br><br>\n",
    "  - At `Step 3: Configure stack options` scroll down to the bottom of the page then simply tick the check box next to the statement: `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with customised names.` then click `Next`.\n",
    "  - At `Step 4: Configure stack options`, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the `Submit` button. Your stack (we called `stream`) will now deploy and will show `ℹ CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` while it deploys. After about 3 minutes it should show the message `ℹ CREATE_COMPLETE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "⌚ Using an AWS CloudFormation template in this workshop saves time by automating resource setup, avoiding manual clicks in the AWS Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudFormation templates are common in DevOps for creating consistent environments across development, testing, and production. In this workshop, the template sets up a single-node Redshift cluster (dc2.large) with basic authentication and permissive security settings to simplify access and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is for learning purposes and does not include production-grade features like private endpoints or stricter security controls. Learn more about CloudFormation templates here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How to explore your stack `Outputs`**\n",
    "  - Once your stack shows `ℹ CREATE_COMPLETE`, click on the `Outputs` tab. This is a set of URLs created by the deployment for the key resources you will use in this workshop. Ideally keep this page open during the workhsop so you can come back here and easily navigate to different parts of the application.\n",
    "  - Let's start by simply opening the S3 bucket that will be our data lake. Right click on the URL  to the right of the key `DataLakeBucketURL` and select `Open link in new tab`. This will open the S3 bucket used to store streamed weather data in this application.\n",
    "  ![CloudFormation_datalake](./images/CloudFormation_datalake.png)<br>\n",
    "  - Great, now that you know how to quickly navigate key resources in this data streaming application, in the next section we will open and explore key resources in a logical order across this architecture, beginning with the Producer!!\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "## 🗺️ Task 2: Explore and understand your streaming application so far\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this task, we will systematically explore the core data processing pipeline that has been provisioned for you. You'll examine how weather data flows through the ingestion layer (Lambda and Kinesis), into the storage layer (S3 data lake), creating the foundation for analytics workloads.\n",

    "### ✨ 1 PRODUCER: Explore the Data Producer (Lambda Function):\n",
    "    - This represents the start where real-time weather data enters our system. The combination of Lambda and EventBridge creates a reliable, serverless data collection mechanism that will continuously feed data into our streaming pipeline. Let's explore them.\n",
    "   - First, from your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate the `LambdaFunctionURL` and open it in a new tab.\n",
    "   - This Lambda function serves as our data producer - think of it as an automated weather station that collects and reports data every minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Lambda](./images/Lambda.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "🌦️ Before we explore the code, let's understand our data source. We're using the Open-Meteo Weather API (https://open-meteo.com/), which provides free weather data for educational and development purposes. We chose this API deliberately for our workshop because its both free and doesn't require any authentication or API keys, eliminating the complexity of credential management. This means the application starts calling the API immediately without you needing to register and manage access tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a production environment, you'd typically need to handle API authentication, rate limiting, and usage tracking, but by removing these complexities here, we can focus purely on building our data pipeline and analytics capabilities. We will explore these important production considerations in Workshop 13: 'Integrating  API Data Sources'.\n",
    "      \n",
    "You can explore the API documentation at https://open-meteo.com/en/docs to understand all the available weather parameters. For our workshop, we're using just a subset of the available data (current temperature) to keep things focused, but in a real-world application, you might want to collect additional parameters like humidity, wind speed, or precipitation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - Let's examine how the Lambda function collects and streams weather data bey reviewing its Python code shown below.\n",
    "   - The Lambda handler function manages the flow of data flow by pulling from the weather API to a Kinesis data stream. It uses `boto3` to connect to Kinesis, with the stream name configured through environment variables from our CloudFormation template.\n",
    "   - The process follows a logical flow of:\n",
    "        - The code stores coordinates for three UK cities (London, Manchester, Edinburgh) in a list called `locations`.\n",
    "        - A helper function called ` def fetch_weather_data()` handles the API interaction, transforming raw weather data into a structured format with city name, temperature, and timestamps\n",
    "        - The main processing loop (that begins with `for location in locations:`) collects data for each city from the API and streams it to a Kinesis data stream, using the city name as the partition key for organised downstream processing we will look at shortly.\n",
    "        - Logging tracks successes and failures and can be seen below as the `response` object finally retunred by the overall Lambda handler function. \n",

    "        ![EventBridge](./images/EventBridge.png)<br>\n",
    "        - Notice in the `Event schedule` the text `Fixed rate of 1 minute`. Click on the `Edit` button to the right and notice how in the `Schedule pattern` you could change the rate unit to be any number of `Minutes`, `Hours` or `Days`. Or, you could also change the schedule type to be a cron expression for specific minutes, hours, day of month, month, day of week and year.\n",
    "        ![EventBridgeRate](./images/EventBridgeRate.png)<br>    \n",
    "        - This rule acts like an automated timer, invoking our Lambda function every minute.\n",

    "            - In the search bar at the top type `CloudWatch`, \n",
    "            - Then in the left hand menu of CloudWatch select from within `Logs`, `Log groups` then click on the Log group called `/aws/lambda/weather-analytics-producer-dev`\n",

    "### 🗃️ 2 BROKER: View data in the Data Stream (Kinesis):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We saw that the lambda function pulled weather data for three cities from the weather API and streamed those to a Kinesis data stream with the following code: `kinesis_client.put_record(StreamName=stream_name, Data=json.dumps(weather_data), PartitionKey=weather_data[\"city\"])` Let's now explore that resource to understand how this broker works.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - From your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate `KinesisStreamURL` and open in a new tab.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - This Kinesis stream acts as our real-time data buffer, receiving weather data from the Lambda function and temporarily storing it for downstream consumers like Kinesis Firehose. Think of it as a moving window of data that maintains records for 24 hours.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - The stream uses the city name as a partition key, helping organize data for downstream processing. This partitioning ensures data from the same city goes to the same shard, maintaining order within each city's data stream. This was achieved in the Python code shown above where we set `PartitionKey=weather_data[\"city\"]`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Let's now use the Data Viewer to inspect data in our Kinesis Stream:\n",
    "      1. Select the `Data Viewer` tab\n",
    "      2. Choose the single shard available from the `Shard` drop-down\n",
    "      3. From `Starting Position` drop-down, select `Trim horizon`\n",
    "      4. Click `Get records` to view the most recent weather data from our cities\n",
    "    ![KinesisDataStreamDataViewer](./images/KinesisDataStreamDataViewer.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "📁 Our stream uses one shard because our data volume (3 cities × 1 record/minute = 3 records/minute) is well within a single shard's capacity of 1,000 records/second. This is perfect for workshop purposes and cost-efficient. VALIDATE WITH DOCS IN GEMINI\n",
    "```\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    " ⌚`Trim horizon` works because it shows all records in the stream's 24-hour retention window, letting you see historical data. `Latest` might not show records immediately because it only shows data that arrives after you start viewing. Since our Lambda writes once per minute, you might need to wait for the next data collection cycle to see new records.\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 📩 3 CONSUMER: Examine the Data Transformation (Kinesis Firehose):\n",
    "  - From your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate `KinesisFirehoseURL` and open in a new tab.\n",
    "    - Kinesis Firehose acts as our delivery service, taking data from the Kinesis stream and preparing it for long-term storage in S3. Let's explore its key configurations:\n",
    "        - Click on the `weather-analytics-firehose-dev` delivery stream\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Examine these important settings:\n",
    "        - **Dynamic Partitioning**: Notice how this feature is enabled in the `Dynamic partitioning` section. It automatically organises our data in S3:\n",
    "            - Enabled with a partition key based on `city` using the JQ expression `.city`\n",
    "            - Creates a logical hierarchy in S3 using the prefix pattern you can see of:\n",
    "              ```\n",
    "              weather-data/location=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:city}/year=!{timestamp:yyyy}/month=!{timestamp:MM}/day=!{timestamp:dd}/\n",
    "              ```\n",
    "            - This pattern means data is automatically organised by city, year, month, and day\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Error Handling**: Notice the error output prefix:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            errors/!{firehose:error-output-type}/!{timestamp:yyyy}/!{timestamp:MM}/!{timestamp:dd}/\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            This helps track and debug any processing issues by organising any error logs in a similar hierarchical structure  \n",
    "        - **Buffering**: Scroll to the bottom of the page and expand the section `Buffer hints, compression, file extension and encryption`. Notice how Firehose buffers data for either:\n",
    "            - 60 seconds (time-based buffer) OR\n",
    "            - 64MB (size-based buffer)\n",
    "            - Whichever threshold is met first triggers a write to S3\n",
    "        \n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "📦 The buffering configuration balances between data freshness and storage efficiency. Smaller buffers mean fresher data but more S3 write operations, while larger buffers are more cost-effective but introduce more latency. Our 60-second buffer is ideal for our workshop environment where we want to see results quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "🗂️ The dynamic partitioning structure provides efficient querying later. By organising data by city and time components, we can quickly locate specific data subsets without scanning the entire dataset. For example, finding all London temperatures for a specific month becomes a targeted operation.\n",
    "```\n",

    "       1. Click into the `weather-data` folder\n",
    "       2. Notice the hierarchical organisation created by Kinesis Firehose we explored previously:\n",
    "           - First level: `location=cityname` (e.g., `location=London`)\n",
    "           - Second level: `year=YYYY`\n",
    "           - Third level: `month=MM`\n",
    "           - Fourth level: `day=DD`\n",
    "       3. Navigate down through these levels to find the actual data files\n",
    "       4. Notice the `.gz` extension on the files - this indicates GZIP compression\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Key features to observe:\n",
    "       - **Partitioning Structure**: The folder hierarchy directly matches the Firehose prefix pattern we examined earlier:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         weather-data/location=city/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         This isn't just tidy organisation, it supports  efficient querying\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - **File Formats**: \n",
    "           - Files are automatically compressed using GZIP\n",
    "           - Each file contains multiple weather records collected during the 60-second buffer window\n",
    "           - File names include timestamp information for easy tracking\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - **Lifecycle Management**: The bucket has intelligent lifecycle rules that were defined in the CloudFormation template you deployed:\n",
    "           - Data moves to Infrequent Access (IA) storage after 90 days\n",
    "           - Archives to Glacier storage after 180 days\n",
    "           - This tiered approach optimises storage costs\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "💾 The combination of GZIP compression and intelligent lifecycle policies helps manage storage costs as your data grows. For examle, in a production environment, with years of historical weather data for many more locations the savings could become significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 The partitioned structure isn't just for organisation, it enables targeted data access. When you later query this data with Athena or process it with Glue, it can efficiently access specific time periods or locations without scanning the entire dataset.\n",
