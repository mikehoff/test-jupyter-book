    "# Data Engineer Workshop 9: Advanced Stream Processing Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± Building on Previous Workshops: From On-Demand to Batch and Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workshop journey so far through different data processing patterns has prepared us for today's exploration of streaming architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Workshop 5, we learned how to make data rapidly available for analysts using AWS cloud services. We transformed CSV files into optimised Parquet format, used Glue to automatically discover and catalogue data structures, and enabled quick analysis through Athena's serverless querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "![workshop5-final-arch_01](./images/workshop5-final-arch_01.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Workshop 7 then introduced the challenges of keeping analytical data current as source systems change. Using the Sakila DVD rental database, we built automated pipelines in Azure Synapse to detect changes in our OLTP data source and update our dimensional model (the customer dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "![workshop_07_architecture](./images/workshop_07_architecture.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we can combine these practical insights as we move from periodic batch processing to continuous streaming. So instead of waiting to gather changes and process them on a schedule (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly), we'll build a pipeline that can processes weather data from an API in real-time as it arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new streaming architecture will:\n",
    "- Ingest data continuously through Kinesis streams (versus periodic batch loads in Workshop 5)\n",
    "- Process records immediately as they arrive (versus scheduled updates)\n",
    "- Enable multiple downstream consumers to analyse the same data stream\n",
    "- Support both real-time analytics and historical querying\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workshop_09_architecture.drawio](./images/Workshop_09_architecture.drawio.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach particularly suits use cases where data freshness is a key businesss requirement, like monitoring weather conditions, tracking financial transactions, or analysing Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data (e.g. monitoring vibration sensors on factory equipment that need to detect and report dangerous oscillations within seconds to prevent catastrophic machine failures). \n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through today's exercises, consider how streaming might complement the batch processing patterns you've already learned, and when each approach might be most appropriate for your own organisation or even your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Should we really be streaming data?\n",
    "\n",
    "While streaming architectures can help answer *\"what's happening right now?\"* versus historical *\"what happened?\"* analysis, it's important to carefully evaluate whether real-time data serves a genuine business need. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Value**: Does real-time insight enable better decision-making or customer experience that justifies the additional complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **True Requirements**: If your stakeholders request *\"real-time\"* data, would near real-time or daily batch updates suffice?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:  Streaming architectures can introduce complexity we will encounter directly in the workshop exercises. While the examples of complexity below may not be immediately clear now, some will become concrete as you build and test each component of our weather streaming data pipeline:\n",
    "    - Error handling and recovery (e.g. handling failed API calls to the weather service, managing retry logic for Kinesis stream failures, dealing with Lambda function timeouts)\n",
    "    - Data consistency and ordering (e.g. ensuring weather readings from different cities arrive in the correct chronological order, handling duplicate temperature measurements from multiple collections of the same reading)\n",
    "    - Infrastructure management (e.g. monitoring Kinesis stream throughput capacity, managing Lambda concurrency limits, scaling Firehose delivery performance)\n",
    "    - Monitoring and alerting (e.g. tracking end-to-end latency from weather measurement time to Redshift availability, detecting gaps in city data collection, alerting on abnormal temperature variations)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative Approaches**: Could simpler solutions work?\n",
    "  - On-demand updates (Workshop 5)\n",
    "  - Scheduled batch processing (Workshop 7)\n",
    "  - More frequent but still batch-based loads\n",
    "\n",
    "As Zach Wilson provocatively notes in this X post: *\"Stop building streaming pipelines when your stakeholders request 'real time' data!\"*\n",

    "This afternoon, as well as reflecting on the practical exercises here we'll explore how to evaluate these tradeoffs for your specific project needs and stakeholder requirements.\n",

    "### ü§ù Alignment with Data Engineer Pass Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",

    "- **Describes how they use data ingestion frameworks such as streaming, batching and on demand services to move data from one location to another in order to optimise data ingestion processes. (K18, S15)**  \n",
    "  We focus on streaming and this workshop demonstrate different kinds of streaming patterns and consider their optimisation and business uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describes the types and uses of data engineering tools in their own organisation and how they apply them. (K20)**  \n",
    "    This workshop covers multiple AWS data engineering tools that represent common architectural patterns you'll find across different cloud platforms and on-premises solutions. By understanding these core patterns, you can be better equipped to understand and describe equivalent tools in your own organisation, whether they use AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or open-source alternatives like Kafka. Here are the AWS tools we will use and their equivalents from other providers.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - **AWS Lambda: Functions as a Service:** A serverless compute service that lets us run code without having to provision a server. If your organisation uses Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions you'll find the concepts very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Amazon EventBridge: Event Orchestration Service:** A serverless \"event bus\" that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own applications. Think of it like a smart postal sorting office for your data. Just as a postal service routes packages to their correct destinations based on addresses, EventBridge routes data \"packages\" (events) to the right applications based on rules you define. For example, in our workshop, it's what makes sure our Lambda function gets \"woken up\" every minute to collect new weather data. While your organisation might use Azure Event Grid, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, or Apache Kafka for event orchestration, the fundamental patterns of event-driven architecture remain the same.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Amazon Kinesis Data Stream: Streaming Broker:** A massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. Think of it as a continuously flowing river of data that can handle hundreds of terabytes of data per hour from multiple sources! The patterns you learn here apply equally to Azure Event Hubs, Google Cloud Pub/Sub streams, or Apache Kafka topics.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Amazon Kinesis Firehose: Streaming Consumer:** A fully managed service that reliably loads streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. These concepts map directly to services like Azure Stream Analytics, Google Cloud Dataflow, or Kafka Connect in your organisation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **AWS Glue: Serverless ETL Service** A fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load your data for analytics. Whether your organisation uses Azure Data Factory, Google Cloud Dataflow, or Apache NiFi, the ETL principles remain consistent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Amazon Athena: Serverless Query Service:** An interactive query service that makes it easy to analyse data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Your organization might use Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pools (we used these in workshop 7) or Google BigQuery, but the concept of serverless SQL querying is universal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Amazon Redshift: Cloud Data Warehouse:** A fully managed, OLAP data warehouse service. While your organisation might use Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pools (we used these in workshop 7), Google BigQuery, or Snowflake, the fundamental concepts of cloud data warehousing remain the same.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These services work together to create a comprehensive data engineering pipeline: EventBridge triggerers the Lambda function, which can process data and send it to Kinesis Streams. Firehose can then load this data into S3, where it can be cataloged by Glue, queried by Athena, and eventually loaded into Redshift for complex analytics! We will do all this together!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explains the deployment approaches processes for new data pipelines and automated processes. (K8)**  \n",
    "   - In this workshop we will walk through the complete deployment of a real-time weather data pipeline in a learning environment, using an infrastructure-as-code approach with CloudFormation. The pipeline flows through these key layers:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    **‚ú® 1. PRODUCER:** Lambda function collects weather data via API<br>\n",
    "    üîª<br>\n",
    "    **‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è 2. BROKER:** Kinesis Data Stream buffers real-time data<br>\n",
    "    üîª<br>\n",

    "    üîª<br>\n",
    "    **üìà 5. PROCESSING/ANALYTICS:** Glue for processing, Athena for querying, Redshift for warehousing<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In Going Further, there is an exercise to automate and orchestrate this entire flow through Glue Workflows, demonstrating how to coordinate data ingestion, transformation, and loading processes in a systematic way. Note we will consider orchestration practically and in more detail in Workshop 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demonstrates how they used security, scalability and governance when automating data pipelines using programming languages and data integration platforms with graphical user interfaces. (K13, S4)** \n",
    "    - While this workshop uses purposefully permissive security settings (public subnets, broad IAM roles, simplified authentication) to facilitate learning, we will later emphasise how these would need to be hardened for production use, such as implementing private subnets with NAT Gateways, restrictive security groups, and AWS Secrets Manager for credentials. \n",
    "    - Don't worry if some of these terms sound unfamiliar or complex, they're just specific tools that help with security and are typically handled by cloud security engineers and infrastructure teams working alongside data engineers to ensure both security and performance. The main point being that all these technical controls serve one clear purpose: to ensure your data only flows exactly where it should, is only accessed by exactly who should access it, and remains protected at every step of its journey through your pipeline.\n",

    "### üå¨Ô∏è Today's Workshop Scenario and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time weather monitoring is essential for many industries. Consider these business use cases for streaming weather data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wind Energy**: Wind farm operators need immediate temperature alerts to prevent turbine damage and optimise power generation. When temperatures exceed 35¬∞C, they must quickly adjust operations to prevent overheating of mechanical components. Historical temperature analysis helps schedule maintenance during optimal weather windows, potentially saving millions in repair costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transportation**: Railway operators monitor temperature changes across thousands of miles of track, as sudden temperature variations can compromise rail integrity. Their monitoring systems must detect concerning temperature gradients in real-time while building historical analysis to identify vulnerable sections requiring extra monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retail**: Major supermarket chains adjust inventory and staffing based on temperature forecasts and real-time conditions. A sudden temperature spike can drive demand for certain products up by 300%, requiring rapid supply chain adjustments based on both current readings and historical sales patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smart Buildings**: Modern commercial buildings use temperature data streams to automatically optimize HVAC operations (Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), typically achieving 30-50% energy savings through real-time adjustments and predictive optimisation based on historical patterns. This requires both immediate response to current conditions and analysis of long-term temperature trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our workshop, we'll focus on wind energy, where weather data directly impacts operations and revenue. As noted in \"The Impact of Weather on Wind Farms\" (2024): https://www.infoplaza.com/en/blog/the-impact-of-weather-on-wind-farms\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"The power output of a turbine is related to density, which is a function of altitude, pressure, and also temperature. Dense air (which comes with lower temperatures) exerts more force on the rotors, resulting in a higher power output, even at relatively lower wind speeds compared to warmer and less dense air.\"*\n",
    "![Turbines](./images/turbine.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A wind farm operator has approached you to prototype a real-time temperature monitoring system. While their production system will need to monitor hundreds of turbine locations and track multiple weather parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity), they want to start with a proof-of-concept using just temperature data from three cities to validate the approach. This temperature monitoring is needed as *\"extreme heat can cause overheating of the turbine's electrical and mechanical components as well as lubrication systems, potentially leading to shutdowns and increased maintenance costs.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a typical project progression that you learned about in module `9.1\tFrom Prototype to Production: Implementing Data Solutions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scoping (Current)**: We've identified the core requirements: tracking temperature variations that could impact turbine performance and maintenance scheduling.\n",
    "2. **Prototype (This Workshop)**: Building a working demo with 3 locations using AWS services to get rapid stakeholder feedback.\n",
    "3. **Development**: Will expand to all turbine locations using exact Lat and Lon co-ordinates, add wind speed and humidity monitoring, implement production-grade security, and integrate with turbine control systems.\n",
    "4. **Production**: Full deployment with comprehensive monitoring, automated scaling, and disaster recovery\n",
    "5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular evaluation of performance, costs, and new requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Using AWS's serverless and streaming services, we'll build this initial prototype. By the end of this workshop, you will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a complete data streaming infrastructure using CloudFormation  \n",
    "- Created an automated data collection system that pulls weather data every minute using Lambda\n",
    "- Built a resilient streaming pipeline using Kinesis services\n",
    "- Developed a streaming pipeline that:\n",
    "    - Processes weather readings from three UK cities (expandable to more locations)\n",
    "    - Automatically partitions data by location and time for efficient querying\n",
    "- Tested the pipeline by:\n",
    "    - Monitoring real-time data flows through CloudWatch\n",
    "    - Querying historical weather patterns using Athena\n",
    "    - Creating analytical views for temperature trend analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will provide practical experience with:\n",
    "    - Infrastructure-as-code deployment using CloudFormation\n",
    "    - Real-time data collection using Lambda and EventBridge\n",
    "    - Stream processing with Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose\n",
    "    - Data lake organisation and partitioning strategies \n",
    "    - SQL analytics using Athena and Redshift\n",
    "    - ETL workflow automation / orchestration using AWS Glue\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prototype, your pipeline will perform two main operations:\n",
    "1. **Real-time Processing**: Continuously collect and stream temperature data from multiple locations, helping operators monitor conditions that could impact turbine performance.\n",
    "2. **Historical Analytics**: Automatically organise historical weather data in the data lake for analysing temperature patterns and optimising maintenance schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the workshop, you will have built this architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workshop_09_architecture.drawio](./images/Workshop_09_architecture.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Task 1: Configuring the Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Task 1 we set up the development environment for our prototype where weather data streaming and analytics can take place. This involves deploying a comprehensive AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation, which will create multiple interconnected services including a data ingestion pipeline (Lambda and Kinesis), storage layer (S3 data lake), and foundational analytics services (Redshift cluster and Glue database).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start an ACG AWS sandbox:** \n",
    "  - Use this link and start `AWS Sandbox - Default` and log in: https://learn.acloud.guru/cloud-playground/cloud-sandboxes <br>\n",
    "  ![AWS_ACG_start](./images/AWS_ACG_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy AWS CloudFormation template:** \n",
    "  - Once logged in search for `CloudFormation`. \n",
    "  - At the top, click on the far right drop down `Create stack` and select `With new resources (standard)`\n",
    "  - At `Step 1: Create Stack` copy and paste this URL `https://da5corndel.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/CloudFormation_streaming.yaml` into the `Amazon S3 URL` box and click `Next`.\n",
    "  ![CloudFormation_S3_URL](./images/CloudFormation_S3_URL.png)<br><br>\n",
    "  - At `Step 2: Specify stack details`, many parameters are already complete so do not need to be changed. Your only task is to complete the `Provide a stack name` field. This name will dynamically generate resource names based on the stack name you provide. To simplify, use `stream` (all lowercase) as the stack name. Then, click `Next`.\n",
    "  ![CloudFormation_step2](./images/CloudFormation_step2.png)<br><br>\n",
    "  - At `Step 3: Configure stack options` scroll down to the bottom of the page then simply tick the check box next to the statement: `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with customised names.` then click `Next`.\n",
    "  - At `Step 4: Configure stack options`, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the `Submit` button. Your stack (we called `stream`) will now deploy and will show `‚Ñπ CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` while it deploys. After about 3 minutes it should show the message `‚Ñπ CREATE_COMPLETE`.\n",

    "````{dropdown} While the template is deploying, click here to access helpful information and troubleshooting tips we recommend reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "‚åõ Your ACG Azure sandbox will automatically shut down and its data will be deleted after four hours. You will receive a notification one hour before the sandbox expires, allowing you to extend it for an additional four hours. Please plan your work accordingly to avoid disruptions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "üîÉ If you encounter deployment issues or want to start fresh, we recommend deleting the entire sandbox from the ACG playground rather than individual resources or the CloudFormation stack. This is faster and ensures a clean slate for redeployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CloudFormation stack includes retention settings for resources like S3 buckets to avoid accidental data loss, and deletion can take 15‚Äì20 minutes due to dependencies between components (e.g. Lambda, Kinesis, Redshift). If you must delete the stack, empty S3 buckets manually first, as their deletion protection will block the process.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "‚õî When using AWS Glue, your ACG sandbox may shut down due to exceeding Glue DPU (Data Processing Unit) limits. You‚Äôll receive an email titled ‚ÄúYour Hands-On Lab or Cloud Playground has been shut down,‚Äù explaining the suspension due to excessive DPU usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue jobs, being Spark-based, provision distributed computing environments even for small tasks, which can quickly hit ACG's limits designed to prevent runaway costs. This restriction is a helpful reminder of resource management in data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your sandbox is suspended, don‚Äôt worry, this is part of learning to use powerful tools like AWS Glue. Simply start a new sandbox and redeploy the CloudFormation template, which will be ready in 3‚Äì4 minutes. Learn more about Glue DPUs and optimisation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-debug-capacity.html\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "‚åö Using an AWS CloudFormation template in this workshop automates the deployment of our entire streaming analytics architecture through infrastructure-as-code (IaC). The template provisions and configures network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, gateways), security components (IAM roles, security groups), and all required services (Lambda, Kinesis, S3, Redshift, Glue) with appropriate permissions and connections between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For learning purposes, the template uses simplified security settings: public subnets instead of private ones, basic authentication rather than AWS Secrets Manager, and permissive security group rules that allow broad access. A production environment would need significant hardening, including private subnets with NAT gateways, strict security controls, and high-availability configurations.\n",

    "3. **How to explore your stack `Outputs`**\n",
    "  - Once your stack shows `‚Ñπ CREATE_COMPLETE`, click on the `Outputs` tab. This is a set of URLs created by the deployment for the key resources you will use in this workshop. Ideally keep this page open during the workhsop so you can come back here and easily navigate to different parts of the application.\n",
    "  - Let's start by simply opening the S3 bucket that will be our data lake. Right click on the URL  to the right of the key `DataLakeBucketURL` and select `Open link in new tab`. This will open the S3 bucket used to store streamed weather data in this application.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This represents the start where real-time weather data enters our system. The combination of Lambda and EventBridge creates a reliable, serverless data collection mechanism that will continuously feed data into our streaming pipeline. Let's explore them.\n",
    "- First, from your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate the `LambdaFunctionURL` and open it in a new tab.\n",
    "- This Lambda function serves as our data producer - think of it as an automated weather station that collects and reports data every minute.\n",
    "![Lambda](./images/Lambda.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "We're using the Open-Meteo Weather API (https://open-meteo.com/) to simulate collecting temperature data from our wind turbine locations. In a real wind farm, each turbine would have its own temperature sensors feeding data directly into our pipeline, but for learning purposes, we're using this public weather API as a reliable source of real-time temperature data for our three \"turbine sites\" (London, Manchester, and Edinburgh).\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this API deliberately for our workshop because it provides free weather data without requiring authentication or API keys. This means our application starts collecting temperature readings immediately, letting us focus on learning how to process and analyze streaming data. In a production wind farm, you'd need to handle sensor authentication, data validation, and careful rate limiting to ensure you don't miss any critical temperature readings that could indicate potential turbine issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the API offers many weather parameters (which you can explore at https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), we're focusing solely on temperature data for this prototype. This mirrors good development practice: start simple with one essential metric (temperature, which directly affects turbine performance and maintenance needs), then expand to include other parameters like wind speed and humidity once the basic pipeline is working well. We'll explore these considerations around scaling up data collection, along with proper API security and management, in Workshop 13: 'Integrating API Data Sources'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's examine how our Lambda function works to collect and stream weather data. The function code shown below in full serves as our \"weather station,\" regularly checking temperatures at our wind farm locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function uses Python and relies on two key tools:\n",
    "    - It uses the Open-Meteo API to collect weather data\n",
    "    - It uses `boto3` (which is AWS's Python software development kit - think of it as Python's way of talking to AWS services, like a translator that lets Python and AWS understand each other) to send that data into our Kinesis stream\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here's how the function flows, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, it keeps a list of our \"wind farm locations\" - the coordinates for London, Manchester, and Edinburgh stored in a list called `locations`. In a real wind farm, these would be your actual turbine coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When it runs, a helper function called `fetch_weather_data()` does the important job of:\n",
    "   - Calling the weather API for each location\n",
    "   - Converting the raw weather data into a clean, structured format that includes:\n",
    "     - The city name\n",
    "     - The current temperature\n",
    "     - Timestamps to track when the data was measured and collected\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main processing loop (starting with `for location in locations:`) is like a continuous collection cycle:\n",
    "   - It visits each city in our locations list\n",
    "   - Collects its current temperature data\n",
    "   - Sends that data into our Kinesis stream, using the city name as a \"partition key\" (think of this like putting each city's data in its own labeled channel)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Throughout this process, the function keeps detailed logs of what it's doing: whether it successfully collected and sent data, or if it ran into any problems. These logs help us monitor our data collection system's health.\n",

    "While this workshop uses a Lambda function to pull weather data, many real-world streaming applications instead have external systems pushing data through an API Gateway. Our Lambda approach is works well for learning as it provides reliable test data and lets us focus on stream processing concepts. However, production environments often need the additional security, access control, and data validation that API Gateway provides, especially when ingesting data from multiple external sources.\n",

    "For example, in a real wind farm deployment, each turbine would likely push its sensor data to an API Gateway endpoint rather than having Lambda pull the readings. This provides better authentication, rate limiting, and the ability to validate data before it enters the stream. We'll consider these architectural patterns more in Workshop 13: 'Integrating API Data Sources'.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We saw that the lambda function pulled weather data for three cities from the weather API and streamed those to a Kinesis data stream with the following code: `kinesis_client.put_record(StreamName=stream_name, Data=json.dumps(weather_data), PartitionKey=weather_data[\"city\"])` Let's now explore that resource to understand how this broker works.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- From your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate `KinesisStreamURL` and open in a new tab.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- This Kinesis stream acts as our real-time data broker/buffer, receiving weather data from the Lambda function and temporarily storing it for downstream consumers like Kinesis Firehose. Think of it as a moving window of data that maintains records for 24 hours.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The stream uses the city name as a partition key, which is like putting each city's data into its own dedicated lane on a highway. Just as having separate lanes prevents cars from interfering with each other's flow, having separate partitions ensures temperature readings from London don't get mixed up with readings from Manchester. When we set `PartitionKey=weather_data[\"city\"]`, we're telling Kinesis \"keep all of London's data together, all of Manchester's data together, and all of Edinburgh's data together.\" This helps maintain the correct time order of temperature readings for each city.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Let's now use the Data Viewer to inspect data in our Kinesis Stream:\n",
    "    1. Select the `Data Viewer` tab\n",
    "    2. Choose the single shard available from the `Shard` drop-down\n",
    "    3. From `Starting Position` drop-down, select `Trim horizon`\n",
    "    4. Click `Get records` to view the most recent weather data from our cities\n",

    "![KinesisDataStreamDataViewer](./images/KinesisDataStreamDataViewer.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "üìÅ Our stream uses one shard because our data volume (3 cities √ó 1 record/minute = 3 records/minute) is well within a single shard's capacity. A busier applications might need multiple shards to handle more data volume: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    " ‚åö`Trim horizon` works because it shows all records in the stream's 24-hour retention window, letting you see historical data. `Latest` might not show records immediately because it only shows data that arrives after you start viewing. Since our Lambda writes once per minute, you might need to wait for the next data collection cycle to see new records.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì© 3 DELIVERY: Examine how data is delivered to the sink (Kinesis Firehose):\n",
    "  - From your CloudFormation `Outputs` tab, locate `KinesisFirehoseURL` and open in a new tab.\n",

    "        - **Dynamic Partitioning**: Notice how this feature is enabled in the `Dynamic partitioning` section. It automatically organises our data in S3:\n",
    "            - Enabled with a partition key based on `city` using the JQ expression `.city`\n",
    "            - Creates a logical hierarchy in S3 using the prefix pattern you can see of:\n",
    "              ```\n",
    "              weather-data/location=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:city}/year=!{timestamp:yyyy}/month=!{timestamp:MM}/day=!{timestamp:dd}/\n",
    "              ```\n",
    "            - This pattern means data is automatically organised by city, year, month, and day\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Error Handling**: Notice the error output prefix:\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            errors/!{firehose:error-output-type}/!{timestamp:yyyy}/!{timestamp:MM}/!{timestamp:dd}/\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            This helps track and debug any processing issues by organising any error logs in a similar hierarchical structure  \n",
    "        - **Buffering**: Scroll to the bottom of the page and expand the section `Buffer hints, compression, file extension and encryption`. Notice how Firehose buffers data for either:\n",
    "            - 60 seconds (time-based buffer) OR\n",
    "            - 64MB (size-based buffer)\n",
    "            - Whichever threshold is met first triggers a write to S3\n",
    "        \n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "üì¶ The buffering configuration balances between data freshness and storage efficiency. Smaller buffers mean fresher data but more S3 write operations, while larger buffers are more cost-effective but introduce more latency. Our 60-second buffer is ideal for our workshop environment where we want to see results quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "üóÇÔ∏è The dynamic partitioning structure provides efficient querying later. By organising data by city and time components, we can quickly locate specific data subsets without scanning the entire dataset. For example, finding all London temperatures for a specific month becomes a targeted operation.\n",

    "       2. Notice the hierarchical organisation created by Kinesis Firehose we explored previously:\n",
    "           - First level: `location=cityname` (e.g., `location=London`)\n",
    "           - Second level: `year=YYYY`\n",
    "           - Third level: `month=MM`\n",
    "           - Fourth level: `day=DD`\n",
    "       3. Navigate down through these levels to find the actual data files\n",
    "       4. Notice the `.gz` extension on the files - this indicates GZIP compression\n",
    "       ![DataLakeBuckets](./images/DataLakeBuckets.png)<br>\n",
    "   - Key features to observe:\n",
    "       - **Partitioning Structure**: The folder hierarchy directly matches the Firehose prefix pattern we examined earlier:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         weather-data/location=city/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         This isn't just tidy organisation, it supports  efficient querying\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - **File Formats**: \n",
    "           - Files are automatically compressed using GZIP\n",
    "           - Each file contains multiple weather records collected during the 60-second buffer window\n",
    "           - File names include timestamp information for easy tracking\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - **Lifecycle Management**: The bucket has intelligent lifecycle rules that were defined in the CloudFormation template you deployed:\n",
    "           - Data moves to Infrequent Access (IA) storage after 90 days\n",
    "           - Archives to Glacier storage after 180 days\n",
    "           - This tiered approach optimises storage costs\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "üíæ The combination of GZIP compression and intelligent lifecycle policies helps manage storage costs as your data grows. For examle, in a production environment, with years of historical weather data for many more locations the savings could become significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ The partitioned structure isn't just for organisation, it enables targeted data access. When you later query this data with Athena or process it with Glue, it can efficiently access specific time periods or locations without scanning the entire dataset.\n",

    "## Wrapping Up and Understanding Real-Time vs Near Real-Time Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workshop has demonstrated near real-time streaming, but let's understand how this differs from true real-time processing and how we could modify our architecture for real-time needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Architecture: Near Real-Time Implementation \n",
    "Our current pipeline introduces several intentional delays:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lambda function collects data every 60 seconds from the weather API\n",
    "2. Kinesis Data Streams acts as a buffer, holding records for up to 24 hours\n",
    "3. Kinesis Firehose manages the delivery of data to S3:\n",
    "   - Writes occur when either condition is first met:\n",
    "     - 60 seconds have elapsed since last write, OR\n",
    "     - 64 MB of data has accumulated\n",
    "   - In our case, with small temperature readings, the 60-second timer typically triggers first\n",
    "4. Glue crawler keeps our data catalog updated:\n",
    "   - Main exercise: Manual runs as needed\n",
    "   - Going Further exercise: Automated 10-minute schedule as part of the orchestrated workflow\n",
    "5. End-to-end timing:\n",
    "   - ~2-3 minutes from collection until data is available in S3 for Athena queries\n",
    "   - If completing the Going Further exercise, both the data catalog and Redshift table refresh every 10 minutes through the orchestrated workflow\n",
    "This creates a near real-time system where temperature data is typically available for analysis within a few minutes of collection, with regular refreshes of our analytical views (Redshift) every 10 minutes if using the orchestrated workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Time Processing\n",
    "To achieve real-time processing we could modify our architecture in several ways including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Kinesis Data Analytics with Apache Flink**:\n",
    "  - Process data directly in the stream using continuous SQL queries \n",
    "  - React immediately to critical temperature thresholds\n",
    "  - Filter, aggregate and analyse data in-motion\n",
    "  - Here is an example tumbling window query analogous to Azure Stream Analytics tumbling windows covered in Module 9.3 Streaming tools and frameworks:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT TUMBLE_START(measurement_time, INTERVAL '15' MINUTES) as window_start,\n",
    "         city,\n",
    "         AVG(DISTINCT temperature) as avg_temperature\n",
    "  FROM weather_source\n",
    "  GROUP BY TUMBLE(measurement_time, INTERVAL '15' MINUTES), city;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Note: Using DISTINCT in the aggregation ensures we don't skew averages by counting the same temperature multiple times, as our Lambda polls every minute but the weather API only updates every 15 minutes\n",
    "- You could start to explore this yourself by going to the Kinesis Data stream, and from the tab called `Data analytics - new` launch true real time data analytics with Apache Flink. Find out more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-flink/latest/java/how-notebook.html\n",
    "  ![ApacheFlink](./images/ApacheFlink.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Firehose Lambda Transformation**:\n",
    "    - Configure Firehose to invoke a Lambda function for data transformation\n",
    "    - Lambda processes batches of records before they reach S3\n",
    "    - Transform data in-flight with up to 5-minute processing window\n",
    "    - Enable data cleaning, aggregation, or enrichment\n",
    "    - Useful for deduplicating temperature readings that are collected every minute but only update every 15 minutes\n",
    "    - Find out more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/data-transformation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lambda Stream Processing**:\n",
    "   - Configure Lambda to trigger on every record\n",
    "   - Remove the one-minute collection interval\n",
    "   - Process each temperature reading as it arrives\n",
    "   - Enable immediate alerts and actions\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The choice between real-time and near real-time depends on your specific needs. For instance with this workshop scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Time Processing (milliseconds):\n",
    "- Critical temperature thresholds requiring immediate shutdown\n",
    "- Emergency cooling system activation\n",
    "- Live turbine control adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "Near Real-Time Processing (seconds/minutes):\n",
    "- General temperature monitoring\n",
    "- Maintenance scheduling\n",
    "- Performance optimisation\n",
    "- Historical analysis\n",

    "1. **Create workshop diagram**:\n",
    "   - Scroll down the web page `https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/` to the section `Drawing and diagramming tools` and note the different tools AWS recommends.\n",
    "   - We suggest starting with `Draw.io` as its free, simple to use and can be used to create professional diagrams in AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, and on-premises architectures: `https://app.diagrams.net/`\n",
    "   - Select where to save your diagram (or decide later)\n",
    "   ![SaveDiagrams](./images/SaveDiagrams.png)<br>\n",

    "   ![drawio_pallette](./images/drawio_pallette.png)<br>\n",

    "### **‚û°Ô∏è Going Further 3:** Direct Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our current pipeline efficiently collects and processes turbine temperature data, but we can explore direct streaming approaches to reduce latency and improve data freshness. These approaches include consuming data directly from the broker (AWS Kinesis Data Streams) using AWS Glue or streaming it straight into Redshift, bypassing the intermediate S3 storage layer. We'll also examine Redshift's native materialized view streaming capabilities. This section will guide you through these options and help evaluate the best pattern for rapid and reliable temperature monitoring, balancing factors like data consistency, operational complexity, and maintenance needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### üö∞ Stream directly in glue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Glue Visual ETL and data source**:\n",
    "   - In the search bar at the top, search for `Glue` and open in a new tab.\n",
    "   - From the left hand menu, from under `ELT jobs` click on `Visual ETL` the click `Visual ETL`.\n",
    "    - On the top left edit the name of the ETL to `Streaming`, then on the top right click `Save`.\n",
    "   - From the `Sources` menu click on `Amazon Kinesis` then click on the node itself on the canvas to reveal the properties of the node ot the right.\n",
    "   - From `Stream name` select `weather-analytics-stream-dev` which is the Amazon Kinesis data stream (Broker) that the lambda function (Producer) writes to every 60 seconds.\n",
    "   ![GlueStream](./images/GlueStream.png)<br>\n",
    "   - So that this ETL has permission to access our Kinesis data stream, click on the `Job details` tab and for the `IAM Role` drop-down select `weather-analytics-glue-role-dev`. Also change `Worker type` to the lower spec `G 1X`.\n",
    "   ![GlueStreamJobDetails](./images/GlueStreamJobDetails.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Glue Visual ETL with data source and SQL transform**:\n",
    "   - Return to the `Visual` tab and you should soon see a `Data preview` of that source data\n",
    "   ![GlueStreamSourcePreview](./images/GlueStreamSourcePreview.png)<br>\n",
    "   - Behind the Data preview tab is an `Output Schema` tab. This is the schema of the data that will output from this node into the next node of the exercise. Note that all types are correct but not the two timestamp fields.\n",
    "   ![GlueStreamSourceSchema](./images/GlueStreamSourceSchema.png)<br>\n",
    "   - To address this, let's add a node after the source node to correct the schema. Click the blue circle with a plus to add another node to the ETL.\n",
    "   - In the `Transforms` tab click on `Change Schema`.\n",
    "   - Select the `Change Schema` node so that its properties show to the right. Correct the two data timestamp data types and drop the final field. After these changes the Data preview should automatically update and show you the data in its new schema, and update the Output schema. \n",
    "   ![GlueStreamChangeSchema](./images/GlueStreamChangeSchema.png)<br>\n",
    "   - Just like in the first going further exercise where we wrote to Redshift we could create a Redshfit table to match our schema and select Redshift as the targer.\n",
    "   ![GlueStreamTarget](./images/GlueStreamTarget.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finalising this direct streaming pattern**:   \n",
    "    - In this direct streaming example we would still have duplications, think about how you could use both a SQL tranforms node and in the Target node to write to Redshift, use MERGE to handle potential duplications? For example, you could use a SQL transform node to deduplicate readings by grouping them by city and measurement time, then use Redshift's MERGE statement in the target node to intelligently update existing records or insert new ones, ensuring wind farm operators see accurate temperature data without duplicates while maintaining the low latency benefits of direct streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Direct streaming into Redshift**:   \n",
    "    - A newly released feature allows streaming data directly from Kinesis into Redshift using \"materialized views\", potentially eliminating the need for Glue ETL entirely. This offers even lower latency for temperature monitoring, though it requires careful consideration of data consistency and error handling. You can learn more about this approach in the Redshift documentation at: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-streaming-ingestion.html\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è While direct streaming offers lower latency, it provides fewer safeguards against data inconsistencies compared to our original architecture. The intermediate S3 storage and Glue-managed ETL process gives us a reliable backup of raw data, easier debugging capabilities, and more robust error handling. These could well be important considerations when monitoring expenisve equipment like wind turbines where accurate temperature data directly impacts operational safety and maintenance decisions.\n",
